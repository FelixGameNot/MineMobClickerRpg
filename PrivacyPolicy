Privacy Policy

GameNot built the Mine Mob Clicker Rpg app as a Free app. This app is provided by GameNot at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my app.

Information Collection and Use
I do not collect any personal data about the players. But as the application was created using Unity and uses some third-party services to realize its capabilities, it can automatically collect some anonymous data about the user. So that you can understand exactly what data can be collected by the application, I advise you to familiarize yourself with the policies of the services I use:
-Unity Ads: https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy
-Google Play Services: https://policies.google.com/privacy

Used permissions
Allowing the application to have unlimited access to the Internet and view network connections is used to download and show ads to users (thanks to this my application is free), it can also be used to send anonymous statistics about the gameplay to Unity servers.

Saving Game Progress
All the progress you have achieved in the application is stored locally on your device (your inventory and received items are stored in a file created by our application on your device. All other data is stored in the register of your device). If the application is removed from your device, all data will be permanently erased.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Therefore, it is recommended that you periodically review this page for any changes. I will inform you of any changes by posting a new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes take effect immediately after they are published on this page.
